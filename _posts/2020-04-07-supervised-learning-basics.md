Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on labeled training data. In supervised learning, all training data exists in the form of input-output pairs, and an algorithm will be used to infer a function which can be used for mapping unseen examples. On the contrary, there is unsupervised learning where the training data is not labeled. In unsupervised learning, the objective is no longer determining unseen instances, is trying to determine previously undetected patterns in a data set with no label and minimal human supervison. In my research, I have very little experience on unsupervised learning so I will only introduce supervised learning with practical examples.

Supervised learning tasks have two general catagories: classification and regression. A classification task aims to identify which category an object belongs to. A regression task predicts a continuous-valued attribute associated with an object.

## Classification Case Study: metal/non-metal classification



## Regression Case Study: predicting materials properties
