hi :)) I'm Ziyan, a PhD student working on applied machine learning on materials science, [our awesome group here](https://www.brgochchemistry.com/)
I started writing these posts in order to help new group members trained on machine learning. Most of us have chemistry backgrounds and have very litter experience of machine learning applications in practice, I learned everything about ML after I joined the group, with the help of senior group members, Ya and Aria, who are some of the most intelligent and kind person I've ever seen, and of course our advisor Jakoah, who is always so supportive.
