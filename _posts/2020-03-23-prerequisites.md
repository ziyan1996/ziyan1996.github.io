first, let's install some stuff

## download Python 3.8.2 for windows
Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a system supported installation of Python. To make Python available on Windows, first download the installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

select the "windows x86-64 excecutable installer"

start the installation, and for the "optional features", you can select all of them, pip will be extremely useful since it allow you to easily install other python packages in the future.

then you will see "advanced features", here we don't need to select all of them.

## install anaconda on windows
Anaconda will allow us to easily manage python libraries and perform machine learning on windows. They have very detailed documentation for installation [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/), just follow this step by step.
