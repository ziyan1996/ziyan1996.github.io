## Fact: computers can not read chemical compositions like us

For example, we know Ca is calsium but it doesn't make any sense to computers. That's why in chemistry and materials science, researchers made a lot of effort in developing data representations for compounds that carry useful chemistry informations. There are several aspects of how we can develope representations for compounds:

*based on compositions*
*based on crystal structures*
*based on domain knowledge (this is where it gets very creative I guess)*
