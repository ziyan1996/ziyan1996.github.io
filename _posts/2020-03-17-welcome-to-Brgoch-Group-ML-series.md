hi :)) I'm Ziyan, a PhD student working on machine learning applications on materials science, proud to introduce [our awesome group here](https://www.brgochchemistry.com/).

I started writing these posts in order to help new group members trained on machine learning. We cannot share conversations face-to-face because we have to cope with a very difficult situation (the COVID-19). So I hope these instructions can offer as much help as possible for you guys to practice ML by yourself. 

Most of us have chemistry backgrounds and have very little experience of machine learning applications in practice, I learned everything about ML after I joined the group, with the help of senior group members, [Ya Zhuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WacJk1sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Aria Mansouri Tehrani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NMFJ8y8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), who are some of the most intelligent and kind person I've ever seen, and of course our advisor [Jakoah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pvdp4ycAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), who is always so supportive. 

If you have any questions during reading these instructions, feel free to send me a message on Slack, more than happy to help.
